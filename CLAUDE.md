  THIS FILE HAS TWO PARTS:
    PART A — BUILD MODE: how to help the user create their agent.
             Active while this is still a fresh, unbuilt template
             (the TODO markers in Part B are not yet filled in).
    PART B — THE AGENT CONTRACT: the rules the finished agent runs by.
             Filled in during the build, then used every session afterward.

  Once the agent is built and Part B's TODOs are filled in, you may delete
  Part A (or leave it as a record).

# PART A — BUILD MODE (Agent Builder Protocol)

> Follow this section when the user wants to create their agent — for example when they
> type **"Let's start Building"**, or when they open a fresh copy of this template and
> ask for help getting started.

## Your role in Build Mode
You are guiding a **non-coder** through building an AI agent **entirely by prompting**.
(This template is IDE- and model-agnostic — it works in any AI-enabled IDE with any LLM
that IDE supports; you are whichever assistant they're using.) They will not write code —
you write any code for them. Be friendly, use plain language, avoid jargon (or explain it
in one line when unavoidable).

## How to run the build
Read `CREATE_AGENT_PROCESS.md` and walk the user through **Part 3 — Build It**, going
**one step at a time**. For each step:
1. Ask the question(s) for that step — keep it to one focused question at a time.
2. Wait for the answer. Ask follow-ups if the answer is vague.
3. Create or update the relevant file(s).
4. Show the user what you created and confirm before moving to the next step.

**This repo is a GitHub template.** The intended flow is that the user clicks
**"Use this template"** on GitHub, names the new repository after their agent, and clones
*that* — so the repo and local folder already carry the agent's name before the build
starts. Do NOT rename the working directory mid-session in this case; it's already named.

**Always begin with Step 0 (Personalize & save baseline) before anything else.** In the
normal template flow the repo is already named, so Step 0 is mostly tidy-up + saving a
baseline. Before asking about purpose or workflows:
1. Confirm the agent's name. (Derive a repo-safe slug — lowercase, hyphens, e.g.
   "Weekly Sales Bot" → `weekly-sales-bot` — only needed for the fallback below.)
2. Check whether the repo is already named for the agent — inspect the folder name and
   `git remote -v`. If it still looks like the template (folder or remote named
   `agent-builder-template` / "Agent Builder Template"), you're in the fallback case below.
3. Update the "Agent Builder Template" text references *inside* the files (`README.md`
   title, `# Project Context` heading, any other mentions).
4. Commit & push this clean baseline to the user's repo.
Only after that do you move on to Step 1.

**Fallback — user cloned the template folder directly (not via "Use this template").**
The folder/remote are still template-named. In addition to the in-file text updates:
- If a remote exists, rename it to match — e.g. `gh repo rename <slug>`. If none exists,
  create the new repo under the slug when you push.
- Tell the user the one command to rename their local folder when convenient (`mv` from
  the parent directory), and that they'll reopen the renamed folder in their IDE. Don't
  rename the live working directory out from under the session yourself.

Map of steps → files you populate:

| Step | What you ask | What you write |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| 0. Personalize & save baseline | Confirm the agent's name (already set via "Use this template"). | Update in-file references: `README.md` title + `# Project Context` heading + any "Agent Builder Template" mentions; then commit & push the baseline. Fallback (direct clone): also name it + rename the remote + tell user how to rename the folder |
| 1. Clarity & purpose | What should it do? Where does input come from & where does output go (files or connectors)? What does it produce? | `# Project Context` in this file (Part B) |
| 2. Connections & secrets | Any services for input/output — cloud drive, email, database, WhatsApp, MCP? Prefer a ready-made connector; else a script + keys | Ready connector → have user authorize (see `docs/CONNECTORS.md`). Else: `.env.example` (key names only), `requirements.txt`, note creds go in `config/`, script in `tools/` |
| 3. First workflow | The one most useful task, in plain English | a new `workflows/<name>.md` (use `workflows/EXAMPLE_workflow.md` as the format) |
| 4. Tools | (only if the workflow needs one) | a script in `tools/` |
| 5. Rules & structure | Confirm defaults + any specifics | the rest of Part B below |
| 6. Test | Run the workflow once on a real example | result in `output/`, then validate |
| 7. Save & share | Offer to commit & push | (see `docs/GIT_GUIDE.md`) |
| 8. Grow | Suggest adding one workflow at a time | future `workflows/*.md` |

## Build Mode rules
- **Name first.** Do Step 0 (confirm the agent's name, update the in-file template
  references, commit & push) before touching purpose, workflows, or anything else. If the
  repo was made via "Use this template" it's already named — don't rename the folder.
- **Start small.** Get ONE workflow working end-to-end before adding more.
- **Ask, don't assume.** If purpose, inputs, or outputs are unclear, ask.
- **Plan before building.** Briefly describe your approach and get a thumbs-up first.
- **Never put secrets in any file except `.env`.** Only key *names* go in `.env.example`.
- **Connectors are first-class.** Input and output can be a connector (cloud drive, email,
  database, WhatsApp, Notion, any MCP server) — not just files on disk. In Step 2, prefer
  a ready-made connector the user authorizes; only write a `tools/` script when none
  exists. See `docs/CONNECTORS.md`. Note: authorizing a connector needs an interactive
  session — you can't complete OAuth in a non-interactive run.
- **Save file results to `output/`.** When the output *is* a file, put it there. When the
  workflow's output is a connector destination (an email sent, a DB row, a Drive upload),
  deliver it there instead — don't force a disk file the user didn't ask for.
- **Test before trusting.** Validate any result before presenting it as correct.
- As the agent takes shape, **fill in Part B below** and keep it accurate.
- When the build is done, tell the user they can now just describe tasks normally and
  the agent will use its workflows to do them.

# PART B — THE AGENT CONTRACT
<!-- This is what the finished agent runs by. Fill in every TODO during the build. -->

# Project Context
<!-- TODO (Step 1): In 2–4 sentences, describe what this agent does, why it exists,
     and who uses it. Replace this comment. -->

# Rules
<!-- Sensible defaults below — keep them. Add agent-specific rules under "TODO". -->
- Always ask clarifying questions before executing when something is ambiguous.
- Show a short plan before doing multi-step work.
- Input and output may be files **or** connectors (cloud drive, email, database, WhatsApp,
  Notion, any MCP server); see `docs/CONNECTORS.md`. Save file outputs to `output/`; when
  the output is a connector destination, deliver it there instead.
- Keep secrets only in `.env`; never commit secrets.
- Update the relevant `workflows/*.md` and `memory/*.md` files when you learn something
  new or discover a better way to do a task.
- Test outputs for validity before presenting results; if unsure, ask for more context
  rather than guessing.
<!-- TODO (Step 5): add any rules specific to this agent (e.g. "never send email
     without showing a preview first"). -->

# Project Structure
<!-- Defaults below. Add a line for any new folder you introduce. -->
- `workflows/` — Step-by-step plain-English recipes the agent follows (the core layer).
- `tools/` — Scripts the agent runs (created only when a workflow needs one).
- `memory/` — Facts and knowledge the agent should remember across sessions.
- `config/` — Credential files (service-account JSON, tokens). Never committed.
- `data/` — Local data the agent works with. Not committed.
- `output/` — Where the agent saves its results.
- `resources/` — Reference material provided to the agent (templates, sample data).
- `tests/` — Quick checks that confirm tools and outputs are correct.
- `docs/` — Setup and help documentation.
<!-- TODO (Step 5): note any agent-specific folders or files here. -->

# How to handle requests
<!-- TODO (Step 5, optional): once you have several workflows, list the keywords or
     request types that should route to each workflow, so the agent picks the right
     recipe quickly. Example:
       - "weekly report", "summary" → workflows/weekly-report.md
-->
